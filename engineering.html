      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Over the course of my first two years at Princeton, I’ve had the opportunity
        to participate in and lead several engineering projects related to my courses.
        Some of these projects include designing and testing a heat engine, soldering
        and programming an accelerometer to calculate trajectories of water rockets,
        programming arduinos to autonomously collect laboratory data, and designing
        wind turbines in AutoCAD to optimize power output. <br><br>

        Below, I have highlighted some of my more notable engineering projects to date:

        I completed this project as a part of the course MAE 221, <i>Thermodynamics</i>,
        with a small group of classmates at Princeton University.
      </p>
      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        This project was an open-ended assignment given to engineering students
        as the final project of the laboratory section of our thermodynamics class.
        The objective of the assignment was to design and build a real-world
        application of the principles of thermodynamics and to collect data on that
        realization, evaluate its value (or lack thereof) from a thermodynamic point of view,
        and write a report on our idea, methodology, and findings.

      </figure>
      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We decided to build a heat engine, and to analyze its power output, efficiency,
        and practicality. Because of our limited budget and time constraints, we
        elected for the Hero's Heat Engine, one of the oldest and simplest engines
        in modern engineering, as our design. An illustration of Hero's engine as it
        was originally designed in the 1st Century A.D. is shown (right). Hero's engine
        is a steam-powered engine that converts heat to rotational motion by heating
        water inside a central orb and allowing the pressurized vapor to escape
        through small nozzles away from the orb. The function of the nozzles are
        to accelerate the vapor and direct its outflow perpendicular to the axis of
        rotation, thus producing a thrust that spins the whole engine.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Our Hero's Engine Design<br>Sketch by Grace Gong</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The design of <i>our</i> engine (right) was very similar to the original design.
        The core of the heat engine was a cast iron 2-inch pipe with a length of 6 inches.
        Both the bottom and top of the pipe were sealed with a similar cast iron cap.
        On the sides of the engine core, two arms extended outward, which served as the
        nozzles for the steam to be directed in a perpendicularly to induce
        rotational movement. The steam engine core had a small opening on the top
        to allow for water injection during the experiment, and the engine itself was
        mounted on a low friction ball bearing, which allowed for controlled rotational movement.
      </p>
      <h5>Testing</h5>
      <figure class="rightmedium">
        <img src="/images-videos/Heros_Engine/Engine_Torch.jpg" width="100%" height="325"
        alt="Stationary Testing">
        <figcaption>Engine During Stationary Testing</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Our testing phase included a series of motion tests and motion tests. During
        motion testing, the engine apparatus was suspended over a stairwell. Coiled around
        the central axis of the heat engine was a string, which, through a low-friction pulley,
        connected the engine to a mass at the bottom of the stairwell. During successive trials,
        masses of 5g, 10g, 15 g, and 20g were attached to the string at the bottom of the
        stairwell. A blowtorch was used to heat the engine, which spun up and lifted
        the mass up the stairwell. During each trial, we measured the time required
        to lift the mass, the angular velocity of the engine, the fuel consuption
        of the blowtorch, and the mass water loss.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        After all of the motion tests were completed, the group ran two “stationary” tests,
        during which the device was fixed in place. In the first test, the saturation
        temperature and pressure within the device were measured as the water heated
        and transformed into steam. This data was used to calculate theoretical efficiencies
        of the device. The second stationary test measured the change in mass of water
        during the time period before the engine began to move. This test was important
        because it established how much of the mass was used to do work and how much
        was wasted in heat-up.
      </p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We used several techniques to calculate the heat input, heat input rate, work output, power output, and
        efficiency. Heat input and heat input rate were calculated using the water mass consumption and the heat capacity
        of water. Power output was calculated as the torque multiplied by the angular velocity.
        Work output, on the other hand, was calculated as the force applied to lift the mass times the distance.
        Finally, efficiency was calculated twice, once as the ratio of power output to heat input rate
        and again as the ratio of work output to heat input.
        We also calculated <i>theoretical</i> values for heat input, power output,
        and efficiency using thermodynamic principles and the parameters of our apparatus.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        As expected, the efficiency of our engine was extremely low (on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup>).
        This was not all that surprising, since Hero's engine is a very
        simple design, but it was an exciting proof-of-concept for the principles
        of thermodynamics and a great exploration of those concepts in real life.

        I completed this semester-long project in the laboratory section
        of the course EGR 191, <i>Integrated Introduction to EMP: Physics</i> at
        Princeton University. A complete, thorough account of the entire project,
        including methodology, mathematics, analysis, graphs, and appendices can
        be found in my
        <a href="/Accelerometer_Project/Jeb_Carter_Accelerometer_Final_Report.pdf" download>
        Lab Project Final Report PDF</a>. The report is a bit dense, so I have included a
        general summary of my work and results in the sections below.
      </p>
      <h5>Abstract/Introduction</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        For this project, I assembled an accelerometer and mounted it on a water rocket
        to collect launch data. Then, using principles of physics and fluid dynamics, mathematical
        analysis, and computational tools alongside known initial conditions, I produced a
        mathematical model to simulate the launch computationally using Wolfram Mathematica. This model considered factors
        such as air resistance, non-ideal high-pressure fluid mechanics, and friction. Furthermore,
        I used the computational model to produce equations of motion and graphs relating
        the position and velocity of the rocket over time in both the vertical and horizontal
        directions. This computational model correctly predicted experimental accelerometer data with
        an error of less than 5%.
      </p>
      <h5>The Accelerometer</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The accelerometer assembly used to measure data during my rocket launch had
        the capacity to measure linear acceleration along three perpendicular axes
        using an accelerometer chip mounted on the circuit board, which contained small
        test masses suspended by springs, outputting accelerometer data based on the
        displacement of the springs. The accelerometer measured acceleration up to a
        maximum of approximately 16g. The accelerometer converted the accelerometer data
        to a digital format using a 13-bit Analog-to-Digital converter.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The accelerometer contained a MicroChip PIC16F690 microcontroller that sent
        data from the accelerometer to memory and contained a highly accurate clock.
        The microcontroller contained both flash memory, used to store the program to be executed,
        and RAM, which stored intermediate results during calculations. It also contained timers and
        multiple input/output ports. The board also contained an additional MicroChip memory
        25AA512 memory chip, which held up to 219 = 524,288 bits of data. The memory was recorded
        into two separate buffers, allowing for two rounds of data of approximately 65 seconds each
        before needing to be transferred to a computer.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Once I had collected experimental accelerations from rocket launches, I determined
        the position and velocity of the rocket at every time by running numerical integrals
        of acceleration values in Wolfram Mathematica. Controlled laboratory tests revealed
        that the calibrated accelerometer had an inherent drift, causing position calculations
        derived from the acceleration to be off by approximately 0.4 m for each second of data
        collection. This offset, along with a few other systematic errors, were accounted
        for during data processing after the fact.
      </p>
      <h5>The Complete Physics Model in Wolfram Mathematica</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        In order to create an accurate physics model for the experimental rocket flight,
        I first separated the launch into three 'phases,' lift-off on the launch tube,
        thrust in the form of water exhaust, and freefall. For each phase, I began with simple
        equations derived from Newton’s Second Law, Fnet = m*a, that could be solved
        analytically for all phases of the flight. This initial model accounted for the
        forces of gravity, pressure, water thrust, air resistance in freefall, and change in the
        rocket’s mass during the water thrust phase. After creating the simplified model, I reevaluated
        the governing equations from each phase to incorporate friction on the launch tube,
        the launch angle relative to the vertical, the flight angle relative to the vertical, and
        the drag force during thrust, as well as incorporating a new phase, the pressurized air exhaust phase.
        The complete model required the use of Newton's 2nd Law, Bernoulli’s equation for incompressible flow,
        Bernoulli’s equation for compressible flow, and trigonometry, creating a complicated mathematical
        model for each phase. For a complete breakdown of all the mathematics involved and
        a complete account of all equations used, please see my
