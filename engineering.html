      This project constituted the culmination of my education at Princeton University.
      Completed as a year-long individual design project, it represents the
      practical, mathematical, and theoretical possibilities of my degree
      in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, as well as my certificates in
      Applications of Computing and Robotics & Intelligent Systems.

    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p class="bodytext">
      This project approached the problem of autonomous sailing from a bottom-up approach,
      first creating a sensory and computational architecture, then subsequently
      building a programmatic feedback control system. The sailing platform is a
      50-inch model sloop collecting wind data from a waterproof rotary encoder
      equipped with a wind vane. The onboard microcontroller, a Raspberry Pi Pico,
      has three autonomy modes: Manual, Pilot-Assist, and Autonomous Tack, which
      runs a closed-loop feedback control system. The feedback controller was
      designed with real-world dynamics data and leverages discrete-time controller
      simulations to verify reliability. Once completed, the vessel was fully
      tested in real-world conditions in the presence of highly variable winds
      and performed admirably, demonstrating a robust and stable controller for
      semi-autonomous tacking.

        Project Final Report PDF</a>. The report is a bit dense, so I have included a
        general summary of my work and results in the sections below.
      </p>
      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The objective of this project was to create an automated computing system which could
        sense, signal, and actuate to accomplish some task involving a model train system. The project
        involved the design and production of a vector board computer with a variety of chips, physical production
        of a model rail system, integration of 2 Hall-Effect sensors, and implementation of
        a wide range of daughter circuit boards including 2 trickle-charge switch control circuits,
        1 power relay circuit, 1 latch circuit, and 1 secondary power supply circuit. The resulting
        system is a catch-and-release system for a dual-train configuration on a closed loop of track.
      </p>
      <h5>Project Summary</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The existing infrastructure of the test stand incorporated a bar code “blocking” system, designating a
        north block and a south block spanning opposite sides of the loop. To prevent collisions, only
        one train could be on a block at any time. Once a train had departed the block, another sensor
        cleared the block, allowing the second train to enter.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The control system developed captured a target train (train #1) from the north
        block onto a separate loop of track, colloquially, putting it ‘in jail’. Once train #1 was brought to
        rest on the diverted track, the north block was cleared artificially, allowing a second train (train #8)
        to enter the block, continue past the jail track, and exit the north track back onto the south track
        on the other side. Once this occured, train #1 could be confident that train #8 was no longer occupying
        the north track. As such, the system released train #1 back onto the north track where it then
        departed the block. At this point, the system had returned to the initial state and repeated the
        sequence. In essence, the capture system always ignored train #8, allowing it to pass jail, and
        always captured train #1, only releasing it once confirmation was given that the north
        block was clear, preventing all collisions. An image of the completed project board is shown below:

      <h5>The Vector Board Computer</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The Vector Board Computer (Schematic Below) was composed of 15 individual circuit
        boards connected with 3M’s Scotchflex system. The board included a power adaptor with an
        accompanying heat sink used to convert the high high voltage from the wall wart supply into a
        usable 5V supply. Running the length of the vector board were two soldered bus strips which
        provided the 5V supply and ground to the entire board. These buses were connected by four 0.1 µF
        de-spiking capacitors. The following schematic illustrates an overview of the board architecture.

        <b>Trickle Charge Switch Control Circuit:</b>
        Two of these boards were used to set the direction of and trigger the railroad switches.
        Each board used two output pins of the VIA on the vector board. The first pin was used to
        drive the directionality of the railroad switches. The second pin drove the discharge of two 4700
        micro-Farad capacitors, ultimately triggering the physical mechanism (relay) to switch to
        the direction specified by the direction bit. By multiplying the resistance of the
        resistor in series with the capacitance of the capacitors, it was possible to determine the approximate charging time of
        the capacitors to be approximately ~9 seconds (for just below ⅔ charging). The power and ground for the
        components were provided by the separate power supply (‘Wall Wart’), while the capacitors
        were charged using the track power. This architecture allowed for repeated and consistent toggling
        of the railroad switches. Since a trigger cooldown of less than 10 seconds was never necessary due to
        the timing of the trains, using a trickle charge circuit with capacitors worked well.
        The figure (right) shows the circuitry schematic of the trickle charge switch control circuit.
        <br><br>
        <b>Track Power Toggle Relay:</b>
        This circuit was responsible for toggling the power to the jail track in order to capture train
        #1. It consisted of a transistor which was toggled by a pin on the Vector Board VIA chip
        as well as a relay which connected the main track power to the power of
        the jail loop. By default, the track power and loop power was open. When power was supplied to the
        relay, they connected and the jail loop received power. The figure (right) shows the track power
        toggle relay schematic.
        <br><br>
        <b>Hall-Effect Sensor Flip-Flop Circuit:</b>
        This board, the schematic for which is shown in the figure (right), was used to sense the presence
        of a train on the jail track and consisted of two Hall-Effect sensors (each with a power, ground,
        and data-out pin) as well as a 7476N Flip-Flop (consisting of set, reset, power, and ground pins).
        The data-out lines for both Hall-Effect sensors were pulled to +5V using a 2.2k Ohm resistor. The
        data-out of the first Hall-Effect sensor (the sensor first encountered first by a train running along
        the jail loop) was connected to the ‘set’ pin for the Flip-Flop, while the data-out of the second
        Hall-Effect sensor was connected to the ‘clear’ pin. Additionally, the data-out of the Flip-Flop chip
        was fed into an input pin on the Vector Board VIA.
        <br><br>
        During nominal operation, train #1 traveled along the ‘jail’ loop before encountering the
        first Hall Effect sensor. The output of the sensor then set the latch of the flip-flop circuit. The
        latch was implemented to provide ample time for the Vector computer to identify the signal from
        the Hall-Effect sensor. Had a latch not been used, it would have been possible for the Vector computer to
        miss the momentary voltage drop from the Hall-Effect sensor (for example, if it was in an interrupt
        sequence), and thus it would have been possible for the computer to never identify the presence of train
        #1. With the latch, the output of the Hall-Effect sensor was stored until the ‘clear’ pin was activated.
        In this design, the data-out of the second Hall-Effect sensor was used as the ‘clear’ pin, unlatching
        the flip flop circuit and making it ready to detect another train.

        I completed this project as a part of the course MAE 221, <i>Thermodynamics</i>,
        with a small group of classmates at Princeton University.
      </p>
      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        This project was an open-ended assignment given to engineering students
        as the final project of the laboratory section of our thermodynamics class.
        The objective of the assignment was to design and build a real-world
        application of the principles of thermodynamics and to collect data on that
        realization, evaluate its value (or lack thereof) from a thermodynamic point of view,
        and write a report on our idea, methodology, and findings.

      </figure>
      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We decided to build a heat engine and to analyze its power output, efficiency,
        and practicality. Because of our limited budget and time constraints, we
        selected the Hero's Heat Engine, one of the oldest and simplest engines
        in modern engineering, as our design. An illustration of Hero's engine as it
        was originally designed in the 1st Century A.D. is shown (right). Hero's engine
        is a steam-powered engine that converts heat to rotational motion by heating
        water inside a central orb and allowing the pressurized vapor to escape
        through small nozzles away from the orb. The function of the nozzles are
        to accelerate the vapor and direct its outflow perpendicular to the axis of
        rotation, thus producing a thrust that spins the whole engine.

        <figcaption>Our Hero's Engine Design<br>Sketch by Grace Gong</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The design of <i>our</i> engine (right) was very similar to the original design.
        The core of the heat engine was a cast iron 2-inch pipe with a length of 6 inches.
        Both the bottom and top of the pipe were sealed with a similar cast iron cap.
        On the sides of the engine core, two arms extended outward, which served as the
        nozzles for the steam to be directed in a perpendicularly to induce
        rotational movement. The steam engine core had a small opening on the top
        to allow for water injection during the experiment, and the engine itself was
        mounted on a low friction ball bearing, which allowed for controlled rotational movement.
      </p>
      <h5>Testing</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Our testing phase included a series of motion tests and motion tests. During
        motion testing, the engine apparatus was suspended over a stairwell. Coiled around
        the central axis of the heat engine was a string, which, through a low-friction pulley,
        connected the engine to a mass at the bottom of the stairwell. During successive trials,
        masses of 5g, 10g, 15 g, and 20g were attached to the string at the bottom of the
        stairwell. A blowtorch was used to heat the engine, which spun up and lifted
        the mass up the stairwell. During each trial, we measured the time required
        to lift the mass, the angular velocity of the engine, the fuel consuption
        of the blowtorch, and the mass water loss.
      </p>

        alt="Stationary Testing">
        <figcaption>Engine During Stationary Testing</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        After all of the motion tests were completed, the group ran two “stationary” tests,
        during which the device was fixed in place. In the first test, the saturation
        temperature and pressure within the device were measured as the water heated
        and transformed into steam. This data was used to calculate theoretical efficiencies
        of the device. The second stationary test measured the change in mass of water
        during the time period before the engine began to move. This test was important
        because it established how much of the mass was used to do work and how much
        was wasted in heat-up.
      </p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We used several techniques to calculate the heat input, heat input rate, work output, power output, and
        efficiency. Heat input and heat input rate were calculated using the water mass consumption and the heat capacity
        of water. Power output was calculated as the torque multiplied by the angular velocity.
        Work output, on the other hand, was calculated as the force applied to lift the mass times the distance.
        Finally, efficiency was calculated twice, once as the ratio of power output to heat input rate
        and again as the ratio of work output to heat input.
        We also calculated <i>theoretical</i> values for heat input, power output,
        and efficiency using thermodynamic principles and the parameters of our apparatus.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        As expected, the efficiency of our engine was extremely low (on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup>).
        This was not all that surprising, since Hero's engine is a very
        simple design, but it was an exciting proof-of-concept for the principles
        of thermodynamics and a great exploration of those concepts in real life.

        I completed this semester-long project in the laboratory section
        of the course EGR 191, <i>Integrated Introduction to EMP: Physics</i> at
        Princeton University. A complete, thorough account of the entire project,
        including methodology, mathematics, analysis, graphs, and appendices can

        <a href="/Accelerometer_Project/Jeb_Carter_Accelerometer_Final_Report.pdf" download>
        Lab Project Final Report PDF</a>. The report is a bit dense, so I have included a
        general summary of my work and results in the sections below.
      </p>
      <h5>Abstract/Introduction</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        For this project, I assembled an accelerometer and mounted it on a water rocket
        to collect launch data. Then, using principles of physics and fluid dynamics, mathematical
        analysis, and computational tools alongside known initial conditions, I produced a
        mathematical model to simulate the launch computationally using Wolfram Mathematica. This model considered factors
        such as air resistance, non-ideal high-pressure fluid mechanics, and friction. Furthermore,
        I used the computational model to produce equations of motion and graphs relating
        the position and velocity of the rocket over time in both the vertical and horizontal
        directions. This computational model correctly predicted experimental accelerometer data with
        an error of less than 5%.
      </p>
      <h5>The Accelerometer</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The accelerometer assembly used to measure data during my rocket launch had
        the capacity to measure linear acceleration along three perpendicular axes
        using an accelerometer chip mounted on the circuit board, which contained small
        test masses suspended by springs, outputting accelerometer data based on the
        displacement of the springs. The accelerometer measured acceleration up to a
        maximum of approximately 16g. The accelerometer converted the accelerometer data
        to a digital format using a 13-bit Analog-to-Digital converter.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The accelerometer contained a MicroChip PIC16F690 microcontroller that sent
        data from the accelerometer to memory and contained a highly accurate clock.
        The microcontroller contained both flash memory, used to store the program to be executed,
        and RAM, which stored intermediate results during calculations. It also contained timers and
        multiple input/output ports. The board also contained an additional MicroChip memory
        25AA512 memory chip, which held up to 219 = 524,288 bits of data. The memory was recorded
        into two separate buffers, allowing for two rounds of data of approximately 65 seconds each
        before needing to be transferred to a computer.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Once I had collected experimental accelerations from rocket launches, I determined
        the position and velocity of the rocket at every time by running numerical integrals
        of acceleration values in Wolfram Mathematica. Controlled laboratory tests revealed
        that the calibrated accelerometer had an inherent drift, causing position calculations
        derived from the acceleration to be off by approximately 0.4 m for each second of data
        collection. This offset, along with a few other systematic errors, were accounted
        for during data processing after the fact.
      </p>
      <h5>The Complete Physics Model in Wolfram Mathematica</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        In order to create an accurate physics model for the experimental rocket flight,
        I first separated the launch into three 'phases,' lift-off on the launch tube,
        thrust in the form of water exhaust, and freefall. For each phase, I began with simple
        equations derived from Newton’s Second Law, Fnet = m*a, that could be solved
        analytically for all phases of the flight. This initial model accounted for the
        forces of gravity, pressure, water thrust, air resistance in freefall, and change in the
        rocket’s mass during the water thrust phase. After creating the simplified model, I reevaluated
        the governing equations from each phase to incorporate friction on the launch tube,
        the launch angle relative to the vertical, the flight angle relative to the vertical, and
        the drag force during thrust, as well as incorporating a new phase, the pressurized air exhaust phase.
        The complete model required the use of Newton's 2nd Law, Bernoulli’s equation for incompressible flow,
        Bernoulli’s equation for compressible flow, and trigonometry, creating a complicated mathematical
        model for each phase. For a complete breakdown of all the mathematics involved and
        a complete account of all equations used, please see my
