    <h1>Engineering Experience</h1>
    <p>
      Over the course of my first two years at Princeton, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity
      to participate in and lead several engineering projects related to my courses.
      Some of these projects include designing and testing a heat engine, soldering
      and programming an accelerometer to calculate trajectories of water rockets,
      programming arduinos to autonomously collect laboratory data, and designing
      wind turbines in AutoCAD to optimize power output. <br><br>

      Below, I have highlighted some of my more notable engineering projects to date:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#Hero">Hero's Heat Engine</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Accelerometer">Bottle Rocket Accelerometer</a></li>
      </ul>
