      <h2>Engineering Experience</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Over the course of my first two years at Princeton, I’ve had the opportunity
        to participate in and lead several engineering projects related to my courses.
        Some of these projects include designing and testing a heat engine, soldering
        and programming an accelerometer to calculate trajectories of water rockets,
        programming arduinos to autonomously collect laboratory data, and designing
        wind turbines in AutoCAD to optimize power output. <br><br>

        Below, I have highlighted some of my more notable engineering projects to date:

      <h3 id="Hero">Hero's Heat Engine</h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
        I completed this project as a part of the course MAE 221, <i>Thermodynamics</i>,
        with a small group of classmates at Princeton University.
      </p>
      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        This project was an open-ended assignment given to engineering students
        as the final project of the laboratory section of our thermodynamics class.
        The objective of the assignment was to design and build a real-world
        application of the principles of thermodynamics and to collect data on that
        realization, evaluate its value (or lack thereof) from a thermodynamic point of view,
        and write a report on our idea, methodology, and findings.

      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We decided to build a heat engine, and to analyze its power output, efficiency,
        and practicality. Because of our limited budget and time constraints, we
        elected for the Hero's Heat Engine, one of the oldest and simplest engines
        in modern engineering, as our design. An illustration of Hero's engine as it
        was originally designed in the 1st Century A.D. is shown (right). Hero's engine
        is a steam-powered engine that converts heat to rotational motion by heating
        water inside a central orb and allowing the pressurized vapor to escape
        through small nozzles away from the orb. The function of the nozzles are
        to accelerate the vapor and direct its outflow perpendicular to the axis of
        rotation, thus producing a thrust that spins the whole engine.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The design of <i>our</i> engine (right) was very similar to the original design.
        The core of the heat engine was a cast iron 2-inch pipe with a length of 6 inches.
        Both the bottom and top of the pipe were sealed with a similar cast iron cap.
        On the sides of the engine core, two arms extended outward, which served as the
        nozzles for the steam to be directed in a perpendicularly to induce
        rotational movement. The steam engine core had a small opening on the top
        to allow for water injection during the experiment, and the engine itself was
        mounted on a low friction ball bearing, which allowed for controlled rotational movement.
      </p>
      <h5>Testing</h5>
      <figure class="rightmedium">
        <img src="/images-videos/Heros_Engine/Engine_Torch.jpg" width="100%" height="280"
        alt="Stationary Testing">
        <figcaption>Engine During Stationary Testing</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Our testing phase included a series of motion tests and motion tests. During
        motion testing, the engine apparatus was suspended over a stairwell. Coiled around
        the central axis of the heat engine was a string, which, through a low-friction pulley,
        connected the engine to a mass at the bottom of the stairwell. During successive trials,
        masses of 5g, 10g, 15 g, and 20g were attached to the string at the bottom of the
        stairwell. A blowtorch was used to heat the engine, which spun up and lifted
        the mass up the stairwell. During each trial, we measured the time required
        to lift the mass, the angular velocity of the engine, the fuel consuption
        of the blowtorch, and the mass water loss.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        After all of the motion tests were completed, the group ran two “stationary” tests,
        during which the device was fixed in place. In the first test, the saturation
        temperature and pressure within the device were measured as the water heated
        and transformed into steam. This data was used to calculate theoretical efficiencies
        of the device. The second stationary test measured the change in mass of water
        during the time period before the engine began to move. This test was important
        because it established how much of the mass was used to do work and how much
        was wasted in heat-up.
      </p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We used several techniques to calculate the heat input, heat input rate, work output, power output, and
        efficiency. Heat input and heat input rate were calculated using the water mass consumption and the heat capacity
        of water. Power output was calculated as the torque multiplied by the angular velocity.
        Work output, on the other hand, was calculated as the force applied to lift the mass times the distance.
        Finally, efficiency was calculated twice, once as the ratio of power output to heat input rate
        and again as the ratio of work output to heat input.
        We also calculated <i>theoretical</i> values for heat input, power output,
        and efficiency using thermodynamic principles and the parameters of our apparatus.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        As expected, the efficiency of our engine was extremely low (on the order of 10<sup>-3</sup>).
        This was not all that surprising, since Hero's engine is a very
        simple design, but it was an exciting proof-of-concept for the principles
        of thermodynamics and a great exploration of those concepts in real life.
