    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a sophomore studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at
      Princeton University. I am pursuing minors in Applications of Computing
      and Robotics & Intelligent Systems. I'm an avid musician and singer as
      well as a Peer Academic Advisor. Additionally, I am Tour Manager and
      Social Media Chair for my a cappella group,
      <a href="http://www.princetonroaring20.com/" title="Go to Roaring 20 Website"
      target="_blank">the Princeton Roaring 20</a>,
      I sing tenor with the Princeton Chapel Choir, and I play on the club tennis team.

    <h2>Engineering Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Over the course of my first two years at Princeton, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity
      to participate in and lead several engineering projects related to my courses.
      Some of these projects include designing and testing a heat engine, soldering
      and programming an accelerometer to calculate trajectories of water rockets,
      programming arduinos to autonomously collect laboratory data, and designing
      wind turbines in AutoCAD to optimize power output, just to name a few.
    </p>
    <h2>Computer Science Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience programming in Java and C. I have worked on
      numerous start-to-finish projects in both languages. Some of these projects
      included implementing a full Unix Shell, implementing heap manager modules
      for system memory management, implementing Burrows-Wheeler data compression,
      and writing code in assembly language. I've worked on several projects using
      AutoCAD and Fusion 360 3D-Modeling software and I am also very comfortable
      working with RStudio, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, Microsoft Office, and Photoshop.
