      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Hello! Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Jeb Carter, and I am a sophomore studying Mechanical and Aerospace
        Engineering at Princeton University. I am pursuing minors in Applications of Computing
        and Robotics & Intelligent Systems. As a student at Princeton, I am a Peer Academic Advisor as
        well as Tour Manager and Social Media Chair for my a cappella group, the Princeton Roaring 20.
        I also sing tenor with the Princeton Chapel Choir and I play on the club tennis team.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        In addition to singing, I am also a piano and guitar player. Other passions of mine include
        the Oxford Comma, for which I am a fervent advocate, and Comic Sans, for which I am
        a fervent opponent. I <i>love</i> a good pun and I am a huge Atlanta United fan!
        (Go <span style="color:Red">ATL</span>!)

      <h4>Engineering Background</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Since high school, engineering has been a passion and a dream of mine, and I've
        always found physics and math to be particularly exciting subjects. As a result, I've had the
        opportunity to work on several engineering projects as an undergraduate at Princeton.
        These projects have been incredibly rewarding and educational, and this website is an
        opportunity to showcase some of the most exciting work that I've gotten to do in Mechanical
        and Aerospace Engineering to date!

      <h4>Computer Science Background</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Computer Science has been one of the most recent and exciting additions to my academic interests.
        Two years ago, I didn't know an if-statement from a while-loop, and I definitely didn't have the ability to
        create large-scale, start-to-finish computational projects in mutliple languages. My freshman year,
        I took an intro computer science class and I haven't stopped since. Since then, it has become a true
        passion of mine, one that I am always eager to incorporate into every project that I work on. In fact,
        it was my interest in computer science that motivated me to create this website in HTML and CSS rather
        than use a template from a website builder. I love the experience of building a project from
        the ground up and watching it come together as I work. It's what draws me to engineering and it's
        what excites me so much about computer science. Similarly to my engineering work, this website is an
        opportunity to highlight some of my most interesting and exciting computer science work
        that I have done to date.
