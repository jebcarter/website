    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Jeb Carter, and I am a sophomore studying Mechanical and Aerospace
      Engineering at Princeton University. I am pursuing minors in Applications of Computing
      and Robotics & Intelligent Systems. As a student at Princeton, I am a Peer Academic Advisor as
      well as Tour Manager and Social Media Chair for my a cappella group, the
      <a href="http://www.princetonroaring20.com/" title="Go to Roaring 20 Website"
      target="_blank">Princeton Roaring 20</a>.
      I also sing tenor with the
      <a href="https://www.princetonchapelchoir.com/" title="Go to Chapel Choir Website"
      target="_blank">Princeton Chapel Choir</a> and I play on the club tennis team.
      <br><br>
      In addition to my singing extracurriculars, I am also a piano and guitar player.
      Needless to say, music is a really important part of my life! Other passions of mine include
      the Oxford Comma, for which I am a fervent advocate, and Comic Sans, for which I am
      a fervent opponent. I <i>love</i> a good pun and I am a huge Atlanta United fan!
      (Go <span style="color:Red">ATL</span>!)

    <h4>Engineering Background</h4>
    <p>
      Since high school, engineering has been a passion and a dream of mine. I found physics and
      math to be particularly exciting subjects, so I came to college knowing that I wanted
      to apply my technical knowledge to solving real-world problems. As a result, I've had the
      opportunity to work on several engineering projects as an undergraduate at Princeton.
      These projects have been enjoyable, rewarding, and educational, and this website is an
      opportunity to showcase some of the most exciting work that I've gotten to do in Mechanical
      and Aerospace Engineering to date!
