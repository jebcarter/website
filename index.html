      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">
        Hello! My name is Jeb Carter, and I am a Senior studying Mechanical and Aerospace
        Engineering at Princeton University. I am pursuing minors in Applications of Computing
        and Robotics & Intelligent Systems. As a student at Princeton, I have served as President, Tour Manager, and
        Social Media Chair for my a cappella group, the Princeton Roaring 20, as well as a Peer Academic Advisor for
        Forbes Residential College. I also sing tenor with the Princeton Chapel Choir and I play on
        the club tennis team.
        In addition to singing, I am also a piano and guitar player. Other passions of mine include
        the Oxford Comma, for which I am a fervent advocate, Comic Sans, for which I am
        a fervent opponent, and aviation, an interest which led me to getting my private pilot's license.
      </p>
      <h5>About this site:</h5>
      <p class="bodytext">
        This website is a bit of a personal blog. During my time at Princeton, I've had the
        opportunity to work on several rewarding engineering, robotics, and computer science projects.
        This site is an opportunity to showcase some of the most interesting and exciting work that
        I've gotten to do in these areas over the past several years.
