    <h2>Musical Work</h2>
    <p>
      Music is incredibly important to me. I play guitar & piano and I sing with
      two groups at Princeton,
      <a href="http://www.princetonroaring20.com/" title="Go to Roaring 20 Website"
      target="_blank">Roaring 20</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://www.princetonchapelchoir.com/" title="Go to Chapel Choir Website"
      target="_blank">Princeton Chapel Choir</a>.
      The first of these groups, Roaring 20, is a Co-Ed a cappella group for which I am
      Tour Manager and Social Media Chair. R20 has around 18 members and we sing a diverse
      repertoire from jazz pieces to classic oldies to today's pop. The second, Chapel Choir,
      is a group of around 80 singers who perform for the Princeton Chapel's non-denominational
      worship service every Sunday on campus.
