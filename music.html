      <h2>Musical Work</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">
          Music is incredibly important to me. I play guitar & piano and I sing with
          two groups at Princeton,
          <a href="http://www.princetonroaring20.com/" title="Go to Roaring 20 Website"
          target="_blank">Roaring 20</a>
          and the
          <a href="https://www.princetonchapelchoir.com/" title="Go to Chapel Choir Website"
          target="_blank">Princeton Chapel Choir</a>.
          The first of these groups, Roaring 20, is Princeton's premier Co-Ed a cappella
          group. The second, Princeton Chapel Choir, is a group of around 80 singers
          who perform for the Princeton Chapel's non-denominational worship service every Sunday on campus.

          Roaring 20, for which I sing tenor, has 15-20 members;
          we sing a diverse repertoire from jazz pieces to classic oldies to today's pop. I serve
          as Tour Manager and Social Media Chair for R20. As such, I am responsible for organizing and booking
          travel, housing, food, events, and performances for 15-20 singers on both domestic and international
          tours. I also manage all social media accounts for the group. In addition to handling several
          organizational- and publicity-related tasks, I also write musical arrangements for the
          group.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          We sing dozens of performances each year, ranging from arch sings to
          concerts to professional gigs in cities across the world. See our most
          recent music video, a mash-up of three Justin Timberlake songs (below).

        The Chapel Choir is a wonderful group of musicians and a close-knit, albeit
        large, family. We sing for the non-denominational church service in the
        beautiful Princeton Chapel every Sunday morning as well as two concerts every
        year, one in the fall and one in the spring. Recent concerts have included singing
        pieces by Mozart, Bach, and Brahms. We've  had the privelege of being recorded
        professionally for a piece in a holiday Christmas album and we boast the largest
        rubber duck collection in all of New Jersey! Singing with the Chapel Choir
        is an absolute joy, and one of my favorite activities on campus. I'm also
        fortunate that Chapel Choir is an on-campus job. As such, all singers are
        paid an hourly wage for both rehearsals and sunday services as employees of the Office
        of Religious Life.
