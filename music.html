      <h2>Musical Work</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">
          Music is incredibly important to me. I play guitar & piano and I sing with
          two groups at Princeton,
          <a href="http://www.princetonroaring20.com/" title="Go to Roaring 20 Website"
          target="_blank">Roaring 20</a>
          and the
          <a href="https://www.princetonchapelchoir.com/" title="Go to Chapel Choir Website"
          target="_blank">Princeton Chapel Choir</a>.
          The first of these groups, Roaring 20, is Princeton's premier co-ed a cappella
          group. The second, Chapel Choir, is a group of around 80 singers
          who perform for the Princeton Chapel's non-denominational worship service every Sunday on campus. <br><br>

          Below is a summary of the musical work in which I have participated, as well as my own personal contributions.

        <p class="bodytext">
          Roaring 20, for which I sing tenor, has 15-20 members;
          we sing a diverse repertoire from jazz pieces to classic oldies to today's pop. I've served
          as President, Tour Manager, and Social Media Chair for R20. At various stages in my Princeton career, I
          have been responsible for leading the group, acting as its public representative, organizing and booking
          travel, housing, food, events, and performances for 15-20 singers on both domestic and international
          tours. I also managed all social media accounts for the group. In addition to handling several
          organizational- and publicity-related tasks, I also write musical arrangements for the
          group. Arrangements of mine include <i>Midnight Train to Georgia</i>, <i>Please Please Me</i>, <i>Karma Chameleon</i>,
          and <i>Imagine Dragons Mashup</i>, all of which are on our brand new album, "Moving In Time". This album was
          the culmination of my time as President of the group, and I hope you enjoy hearing our music.

          We sing dozens of performances each year, ranging from arch sings to
          concerts to professional gigs in cities across the world. See our most recent music video
          below, a performance of "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap. I was the organizer for this project, and I'm
          incredibly pleased with how it turned out.

        The Chapel Choir is a wonderful group of musicians and a close-knit, albeit
        large, family. We sing for the non-denominational church service in the
        beautiful Princeton Chapel every Sunday morning as well as two concerts every
        year, one in the fall and one in the spring. Recent concerts have included singing
        pieces by Mozart, Bach, and Brahms. We've  had the privelege of being recorded
        professionally for a piece in a holiday Christmas album and we boast the largest
        rubber duck collection in all of New Jersey! Singing with the Chapel Choir
        is an absolute joy, and one of my favorite activities on campus. I'm also
        fortunate that Chapel Choir is an on-campus job. As such, all singers are
        paid an hourly wage for both rehearsals and sunday services as employees of the Office
        of Religious Life.

        The video below was recorded during April of 2020, during COVID-19 quarantine.
        Since the choir could not be together to perform for the yearly Easter
        service, the group came together to record ourselves singing our respective
        parts to create an Easter medley from around the world! The video includes over
        50 participants and speaks volumes to the wonderful community and music
        of the Chapel Choir. The piece is "I Got Me Flowers" by Daniel Burton.
