      <h2>Computer Science Experience</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">
        During my first two years at Princeton, I have established extensive experience programming in
        Java and C. I have worked on numerous start-to-finish projects in both languages.
        Some of these projects included implementing a full Unix Shell, implementing heap manager
        modules for system memory management, implementing Burrows-Wheeler data compression,
        and writing code in assembly language, just to name a few. I've worked on
        several projects using AutoCAD and Fusion 360 3D-Modeling software and I am
        also very comfortable working with HTML, CSS, RStudio, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica,
        Microsoft Office, and Photoshop.

      <p class="bodytext">
        The Knight's Tour is a famous, centuries-old puzzle which asks one question:
        How can a Knight navigate a chess board such that it visits every square
        exactly once? I love the game of chess so, naturally, when I learned about this
        puzzle, I became determined to solve it myself.

      <p class="bodytext">
        The problem seems, on the surface, incredibly daunting. My first strategy was to
        use a Mimimum Priority Queue, assigning a 'score' to every board based on the position
        of the knight and the locations of remaining squares. However, this solution
        only succeeded in finding valid knight's tours for boards 5x5 and smaller; anything
        larger would exceed the computer's memory capacity or take too long. This is
        because such a strategy requires that the program store all possible previous boards for
        later retrieval, something that isn't feasible once the paths get very long.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        I realized that, to solve the problem for larger boards, I needed to develop a heuristic
        that would inform the decision of the knight at each move, but not require it to
        consider all possible paths. Choosing this heuristic was incredibly important, as it
        would determine the success of the program. After quite a bit of trial and error,
        I settled on the final, and ultimately successful, heuristic: When choosing the next square
        for the knight, choose the square which will give the knight the fewest available
        moves. Logically, this heuristic makes sense: it's in the knight's interest to keep
        its path compact and fill holes in otherwise visited space. This strategy minimizes
        the creation of 'islands' (unvisited squares to which there are no valid routes)
        because a square that is becoming isolated from other unvisited squares will be filled
        according to the heuristic.

        Compared to my first attempt, the fewest-squares heuristic is superior by orders
        of magnitude. It minimizes the required memory and solves the puzzle in linear time.
        Additionally, by my calculations, the fewest-squares heuristic is successful
        in finding a knight's tour over <b>95%</b> of the time for all boards smaller than <b>80 x 80</b>
        with the knight in <b>any</b> position. Once the size of the boards reaches the hundreds, the success
        rate drops to around 50% and continues to fall as the sizes increase.
